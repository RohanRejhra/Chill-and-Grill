# Chill-and-Grill

Chill and Grill is a mini restaurant website project developed by our group using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

The project uses HTML to structure the website, CSS to design and enhance the user interface and overall user experience, and JavaScript to add interactivity and functionality. JavaScript is used for features such as button actions, image sliders, navigation, and the billing process, including styling and calculation formulas.

The project consists of the following files:

project1.1.html – the main webpage containing sliding images, a search bar, popular items, and the complete menu.

bill.html – the billing page where users enter their details and view order calculations.

project1.1.css – used for styling the website layout and design.

project1.1.js – used to handle interactivity and logic, such as user actions and billing calculations.

This project focuses on front-end development and demonstrates basic web development concepts, user interface design, and client-side logic.
